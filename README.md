LEVEL-3-Task-1


As an intern, I spearheaded a Python project focused on Face Mask Detection, leveraging machine learning techniques. Through diligent coding and model tuning, I engineered a robust system capable of accurately identifying individuals wearing masks in real-time. My internship experience equipped me with valuable skills in computer vision and deepened my understanding of practical applications in artificial intelligence as per the task of Tech-A-Intern i.e., Python Development ----LEVEL-3-TASK-1.
